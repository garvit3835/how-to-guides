# Chrome Extension

[<mark style="color:blue;">Aviator's Chrome Extension</mark>](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aviator-chrome-extension/inoabloekooadaolcncfmpgafkgbgnif) offers a few capabilities:

* MergeQueue - You can enqueue / dequeue your pull-request from GitHub, monitor the status and review the stack.
* AttentionSet - Track all the PRs that require your attention. On the GitHub page for the PR, you can also toggle the attention.

## Installation

Install from [<mark style="color:blue;">Chrome Web Store</mark>](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aviator-chrome-extension/inoabloekooadaolcncfmpgafkgbgnif). After the installation, open your pull-request, and you can find a log-in button instead of the GitHub merge button.

Click the login button, and you'll redirected to the Aviator login page. If you are already logged in, it should automatically get back to the original PR page.

The browser extension is also supported on Arc.

### Pinning the extension

Once installed, you can optionally pin the Chrome extension. This way, whenever there's a PR that require your attention, it will show you a red badge within your browser.

### Connecting with GitHub

To enable the AttentionSet in Chrome Extension, you need to connect your Aviator user with GitHub user. You can find that configuration in Settings > Personal > Integrations , or [follow this link](https://app.aviator.co/settings/personal/integrations).

## How to use

### AttentionSet

The extension shows you the list of PRs that require your attention. These may be PRs that require a review from you, or the PRs authored by you that are waiting for your action after a response from the reviewer.

* If you pin the extension to Chrome, it will show the number of PRs that require your attention as a badge.
* On clicking the icon, it expands a popup view that lists those PRs
* Any PR that is approved and ready to merge shows up with a green bar.
* On the PR details page, you can also view and toggle the Attention for the GitHub users from the right side menu.

### MergeQueue

If the repository is configured with Aviator MergeQueue, it shows a button to enqueue a pull request. This will work properly with stacked PRs as well.

Once the PR has entered the queue, the extension will show information about the bot pull request, and a timeline of the PR's activity. If the queue is currently paused, the extension will notify the user, regardless of the PR's status.

The extension will show updated information if the PR is blocked.
