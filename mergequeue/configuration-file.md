# Merge Rules

MergeQueue communicates with pull request using GitHub labels, GitHub comments and the [<mark style="color:blue;">Aviator CLI</mark>](../aviator-cli/). Merge rules are at the core of how the Aviator bot reacts to the actions taken on GitHub.

Some of the Basic Configuration can be modified using the [<mark style="color:blue;">Merge Rules dashboard</mark>](https://app.aviator.co/github/rules). For more advanced configuration, Aviator supports a YAML based configuration file. This file can either be applied directly from the Aviator dashboard or configured in the GitHub repository.

### Managing YAML from the dashboard

You can directly apply the config on the _YAML configuration_ tab on the[ <mark style="color:blue;">Merge Rules</mark>](https://app.aviator.co/github/validate-config) page. We also recommend validating this configuration before applying any changes.

### Managing YAML from GitHub repository

You can also create a configuration file stored in `.aviator/config.yml`. The file will only be read once it is merged into the repository's default branch. It will also override any properties set in the Dashboard UI.



To review the complete reference guide, go to [<mark style="color:blue;">Merge Rules Configuration page</mark>](reference/complete-reference-guide.md). Find below some common examples to get you started.

## Examples

### Minimalist config

The only required attribute is `merge_rules.labels.trigger`.

```yaml
merge_rules:
  labels:
    trigger: "mergequeue"
```

### Custom required checks

Checkout customizing required checks section for details.

```yaml
merge_rules:
  labels:
    trigger: "mergequeue"
  preconditions:
    use_github_mergeability: false
    required_checks:
      - build
      - unit-test
      - typecheck
      - ci/circleci: pytest

```

### Require all conversation resolution

This enforces all conversations in GitHub to be resolved before the PR can be merged.

```yaml
merge_rules:
  labels:
    trigger: "mergequeue"
  preconditions:
    conversation_resolution_required: true
```

### No approval

Useful for testing. Aviator will only be able to merge PR if the approval is not enforced at GitHub level. By default, Aviator always require approvals.

```yaml
merge_rules:
  labels:
    trigger: "mergequeue"
  preconditions:
    number_of_approvals: 0
```

### Using Parallel mode

Also checkout the [<mark style="color:blue;">parallel mode section</mark>](concepts/parallel-mode/) for details.

```yaml
 merge_rules:
   labels:
     trigger: "mergequeue"
   merge_mode:
    type: "parallel"
    parallel_mode:
      max_parallel_builds: 10
      override_required_checks:
        - build_and_test
        - 'ci/circleci: build'
```

### Automatic requeue

On failure, the PRs will automatically requeue before giving up. Only available in parallel mode.

```yaml
 merge_rules:
   labels:
     trigger: "mergequeue"
   merge_mode:
    type: "parallel"
    parallel_mode:
      max_parallel_builds: 10
      max_requeue_attempts: 3
```

### Auto update

Keep your PRs up to date. Every time a new. commit is added to the base branch, the PRs are automatically updated using rebase or merge commit. See the [<mark style="color:blue;">auto update section</mark>](reference/complete-reference-guide.md#auto-update) in the reference guide.

```yaml
 merge_rules:
   labels:
     trigger: "mergequeue"
   auto_update:
     enabled: false
     label: "auto_update"
     max_runs_for_update: 10
```

### Custom title and body

Customize title and body when merging the PR.

```
 merge_rules:
   labels:
     trigger: "mergequeue"
   merge_commit:
     use_title_and_body: true
     cut_body_before: "----"
     cut_body_after: "+++"
```
