# Set Up SAML Configuration

All of Aviator’s cloud accounts support Google SSO based login. Self-hosted Aviator deployments support Google, Okta, Active Directory, or other SAML SSO providers.

## SAML 2.0

Aviator supports SAML 2.0 based authentication. To request SAML authentication for your account, please contact [<mark style="color:blue;">howto@aviator.co</mark>](mailto:howto@aviator.co). See instructions below for Okta. If you have any other identity provider, please contact us for instructions.

### Note for onprem users

Please replace _app.aviator.co_ with with **aviator.yourdomain.com** in the instructions below.

12\. Copy the url that it opens, this is your **Metadata URL**. It should typically end with: `/sso/saml/metadata`

13\. Go to the **Assignments** tab, and assign the app to the appropriate groups / users to access.

14\. Go back to the SAML configuration page and update the following properties: [https://app.aviator.co/saml/okta/configure](https://app.aviator.co/saml/okta/configure)

* **Metadata url**: Paste the Metadata URL copied from step 11
* **Email domains to allow**: enter your company email domain, e.g. [**example.com**](http://example.com)
* **Click Save and Activate**

This should enable the Okta configuration for your organization. Please verify this by logging out and logging in directly from Okta portal.

Notes:

* This is idp initiated authentication, so you can login in directly from the Okta portal.
* It’s also recommended to post an announcement for your users to explain how the migration will work.

Contact: [<mark style="color:blue;">support@aviator.co</mark>](mailto:support@aviator.co) if you have any issues with the setup.
