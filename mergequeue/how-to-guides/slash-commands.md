# Slash Commands Using GitHub Comments

Slash commands enable teams to manage their pull requests with Aviator directly from the GitHub pull request page. The commands are invoked by including the line `/aviator <command>` anywhere in your pull request comment (as long as it's on a line by itself).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only one slash command per comment is allowed.
{% endhint %}

For instance, to get the latest status of your pull request from Aviator, you can post an `/aviator refresh` command in your PR.

Checkout [<mark style="color:blue;">the reference guide</mark>](../slash-commands.md) for list of all the slash commands.
