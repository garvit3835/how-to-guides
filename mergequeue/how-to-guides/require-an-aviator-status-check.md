# Require an Aviator Status Check

Aviator provides a [GitHub status check](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) that you can enable for your PRs. You can also add this status check as a required check in [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) to prevent developers from bypassing the merge queue. In the branch protection settings, you can find this check with the name: `aviator/checks`.

The check typically contains similar details that you also see on the sticky comment.
