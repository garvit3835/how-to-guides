# Paused Queues

There are cases where you want to pause the queue. For example, during the holiday season, you do not want to get PRs merged. Pausing a queue allows you to control whether devs can merge PRs.

You can pause queues per repository or per base branch (e.g. `main`). This allows you to pause the queue for the `release` branch, while allowing devs to merge PRs into `main`. The control is on the Web UI and provided via API.

When a queue is paused, MergeQueue works processes the PRs up to the merge timing. This includes creating a draft PR for [the parallel mode](parallel-mode/). The [instant merge action](../priority-merges/instant-merges.md) also stops working when a queue is paused.

Deactivating a repository will halt most of the Aviator features on the repository. By deactivating a repository, any queuing actions won't be processed nor any comments are posted from Aviator. The only exception to this is changesets and you can create them in a deactivated repository.
