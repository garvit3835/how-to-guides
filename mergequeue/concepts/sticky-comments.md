# Sticky Comments

In addition to the dashboard, Aviator provides sticky comments to give you the status of a PR within GitHub.

Aviator posts a comment when a PR is opened, and will automatically update the comment as the PR moves through its lifecycle. This is a great way to stay up to date and identify any reasons that may have dequeued your PR or is preventing your PR from merging.

Having a sticky comment makes it easy for developers to find the status of the PR in one place, and also reduces noise if you set up notifications for new GitHub comments.



{% hint style="info" %}
You can also [customize these sticky comments](../how-to-guides/customize-sticky-comments.md).
{% endhint %}



The following are some of the important of comments that are generated when comments are enabled:

* **CI is taking longer than expected.** - This is only applicable in Parallel mode. It can happen if the draft PR CI is completed but the original PR is still pending CI status. If the PR is `stuck`, then the comment will also provide info on when the PR will be dequeued and which CI(s) are stuck.
* **This PR is queued for merge (queue position: \<number>).** - Reports successful queuing along with the current position of the PR in the queue. Info on pending status checks will also be provided.
* **PR failed to merge with reason: \<reason>** - Reports a PR getting dequeued with one of the reasons as described above. It may also contained information about the associated draft PR if relevant along with additional debug info.
