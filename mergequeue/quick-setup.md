# Quick Setup

This setup guide will walk you through the initial set up for MergeQueue. Since most capabilities of Aviator revolve around merging, we recommend you to start here.&#x20;

1\. Create an account. [<mark style="color:blue;">Register here</mark>](https://mergequeue.com/register).

2\. Follow the onboarding flow to connect to the Aviator GitHub app, authorize one or more repositories that you want to automate.

3\. Select the repository on the **Repositories** page to configure the rules.

4\. Add a customized trigger label on the **Merge Rules** page. This label identifies a PR as ready to be queued.

5\. Verify the required status checks are set correctly on the **Merge Rules** page.

6\. That's it. You are ready to go. Now when a PR is ready, tag the PR with the trigger label defined above. Let the Aviator bot handle the rest.
