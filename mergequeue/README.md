# MergeQueue

## Introduction

MergeQueue manages the merge workflow for pull requests in your GitHub
repository and keeps your primary branch passing. When a developer marks a pull
request as ready-to-merge, MergeQueue tests the pull request against the latest
changes in the target branch and merges the pull request only if it passes all
the required checks, ensuring no broken code can be merged into your primary
branch.

## Why use a merge queue?

CI tools can run tests on every pull request when it's opened, as well as on
every branch after it's pushed, but it may not be sufficient to avoid broken
builds.

For example, if two pull requests modify dependent code, checks might pass on
each pull request independently, but the build may still break after the merge
(even if there's no Git merge conflict).

These kinds of _semantic conflicts_ cause broken code to be merged into the
repository's primary branch and negatively impact the productivity of
engineering organizations since developers have to spend time fixing the build
instead of working on new features (and no new code can be merged in the
meantime).

Some organizations configure GitHub to require pull requests be up-to-date with
the repository primary branch to avoid this issue, but this is not a scalable
solution as teams grow. This configuration means every individual engineer has
to:

- Update their pull request to merge the changes from `main`
- Wait for the required checks to pass (again)
- Ideally, merge the pull request
- Less ideally, if another pull request is merged in the meantime, repeat the
  steps above

## How does it work?

MergeQueue provides several [<mark style="color:blue;">queue modes</mark>](/mergequeue/concepts/queue-modes.md)
that are optimized for different types of repositories. All modes follow the
same basic flow:

1. Aviator monitors all pull requests on your GitHub repository.
2. Instead of manually merging pull requests (_e.g._, using the GitHub merge
   button), developers add their pull requests to the queue when they are ready
   to merge (usually by commenting `/aviator merge` or adding a configurable
   GitHub label to the pull request).
3. Depending on your [<mark style="color:blue;">queue mode</mark>](/mergequeue/concepts/queue-modes.md),
   MergeQueue will test the pull request against the latest changes in the
   target branch as well as the changes from every other pull request in the
   queue.
4. When all the required checks pass, MergeQueue will merge the pull request
   into the target branch without any additional effort from the developer.
5. If something goes wrong (such as a failing required check), MergeQueue
   reports the error back to the developer and removes the pull request from the
   queue.

Aviator automatically captures both required and non-required the status checks
from your repository. By default, Aviator will validate the required status
checks configured in GitHub. To learn more about status checks, checkout
