# View AttentionSet for others

AttentionSet dashboard also provides an option to view the AttentionSet for others. This could sometimes be helpful to understand the review load for that person, or help take over someone else’s review.

To view the AttentionSet dashboard for another developer, simply search and select any GitHub username from the dropdown on the top right.
