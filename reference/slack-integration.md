# Slack Integration

### Channel Notifications

You can use the Slack app integration to receive notifications about queue events. Currently supported Slack events are queued, merged and failed. Slack notifications can be enabled from the `Webhooks` page.

### DM Notifications

You can also link your Github account to the Slack integration. The Aviator Slack app will send direct messages about your own PR activity. Simply use the slash command `/aviator github connect` and follow the instructions to complete Github oauth.
