## Customizing Notifications

Aviator supports two types of notifications: **Channel Notifications** and **Personal Notifications (DMs)**.

### Channel Notifications

**Admin privileges required.**

After setting up the Slack integration, you can choose which event notifications you want to receive in your channel. Some default notifications are already enabled.

You can subscribe to notifications for the following events:

* **`MERGEQUEUE_ACTIVATE_DEACTIVATE`** – Notifications when MergeQueue is activated or deactivated.
* **`MERGEQUEUE_CONFIG_UPDATE`** – Notifications when MergeQueue configuration is updated.
* **`MERGEQUEUE_PAUSE_UNPAUSE`** – Notifications when MergeQueue is paused or unpaused.
* **`PR_MERGED`** – Notifications for PRs merged via Aviator MergeQueue.
* **`PR_BLOCKED`** – Notifications for PRs marked as blocked by MergeQueue.
* **`PR_QUEUED`** – Notifications when PRs are queued for merging by Aviator MergeQueue.

### Personal Notifications

In addition to the channel notifications, all Aviator users can set up and customize personal notifications (DMs) in Slack. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Slack and type `/aviator connect` in any channel, then follow the instructions to link your Slack account to your Aviator user.
2. Go to `Settings > Personal > Integrations` in Aviator. If the Slack link is successful, you’ll see your Slack username with options to customize your personal notifications.

You should also associate your GitHub handle with your Aviator user account from the same Integrations page for the Slack notifications to work.
{% endhint %}
