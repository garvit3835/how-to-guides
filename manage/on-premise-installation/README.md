# On-premise Installation

In addition to the hosted version of Aviator (https://app.aviator.co), we provide an option to run Aviator on-premise.

We support two ways to deploy:

* Helm: Using [<mark style="color:blue;">Helm</mark>](https://helm.sh/) to deploy Aviator servers on your Kubernetes cluster.
* Docker Compose: Using [<mark style="color:blue;">Docker Compose</mark>](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to deploy Aviator servers on your on-premise machine.

Both setups require you to bring your own PostgreSQL server and Redis server. For details, contact  info@aviator.co for details.
