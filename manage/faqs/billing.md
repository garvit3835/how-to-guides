<summary>Do I need a credit card to sign up?</summary>

No, the trial period does not require any payment methods. You can use the product risk free for the first 14 days. We will only start charging you after 14 days, so whenever you are satisfied with Aviator, you can add your credit card in the billing section.

<summary>How do I know how much I will be charged?</summary>

We charge based on the number of active collaborators in your repository. Active collaborators are defined as the collaborators who have created a Pull Request and have used Aviator on their PRs. You can review the count of Billed users in the Billing section of Aviator.

<summary>What is the difference between a collaborator and a user?</summary>

A collaborator is a GitHub user associated with the organization or repository. A user, on the other hand, is someone who has access to the Aviator dashboard. There is no cost associated with the number of users you have in your Aviator account for any plan, you only pay based on the number of active collaborators.
