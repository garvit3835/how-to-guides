### Aviator **bot usage**

Represents how many PRs were merged by the bot vs. merged manually segmented by day.

### **PR failure reasons**

Gives you a better understanding of how many PRs are failing to automatically merge and why. The breakdown is done by Failure reasons. You can find more details in the [Error Codes](../reference/comments-and-status-codes.md) section.

The failed PR is counted multiple times if it failed multiple times in its lifecycle.

### **PR sync frequency**

This metric captures how many times the bot pulls the latest base branch into the current PR. This should only happen at most once if everyone uses the Aviator bot for merging the PRs.
